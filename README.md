# Hi, I'm Gerardo

## üî≠ What I'm Working On
- Finishing up the first release of `MGKDB-Web`, a web application for interacting with gyrokinetic fusion simulation data for the fusion
research community
- Practicing my Machine Learning and Data Science skills (check out my `PGA-Analysis` and `This-Pokemon-Does-Not-Exist` repos)
## üå± What I'm Learning
- C programming and embedded systems via reading *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan and Ritchie and experimenting with
 an Arduino UNO kit (watch for updates in my `Arduino` repo)
- How reverse-mode automatic differentiation is implemented (see the `tinygrad` repo I forked)
